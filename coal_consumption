# Case Study: Coal Consumption
## This case study was via LinkedIn Learning for RStudio to give me extra practice.
## It is not intended to be a deep-dive into the data. 


## After previewing the excel file `coal` there are many things we need to do to 
## clean the data.  Column1 has countries, continents and the world mixed together.
## There is a blank row beneath the header/title
## 

## load packages and dataset
## 
library(tidyverse)
coal <- read_csv('http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/coal.csv')

glimpse(coal) ## There was an issue on import! Column names did not carry over
              ## reviewing the csv shows there is a blank row causing the issue

coal <- read_csv('http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/coal.csv',
                 skip=2)
glimpse(coal) ## better - there are rows for each year and columns for each area
              ## row 1 was named `X1` and needs to be fixed

colnames(coal)[1] <- "region"
summary(coal) ## rows and columns look better! Values are all character...

## first let's transform from wide data to long data

?pivot_longer() # `pivot_longer(data,columns,names,values)`

coal_long <- pivot_longer(coal, !region, names_to = 'year', values_to = 'coal_consumption' )
glimpse(coal_long)


## converting from character to integer

coal_long <- coal_long %>% 
  mutate(year=as.integer(year))

summary(coal_long)

coal_long <- coal_long %>% 
  mutate(coal_consumption=as.numeric(coal_consumption))

summary(coal_long) ## 517 NAs

## Region wrangling - includes countries, continents and world. Let's break it apart

unique(coal_long$region) ## let's create vector for continents NOT countries!

coal_continent <- c('Antarctica','Central & South America','Middle East','Africa',
                    'North America','Europe','Eurasia','Asia & Oceania')
world <- c('World')


coal_region <- coal_long %>% 
  filter(region %in% coal_continent) ## all data broken into continents

coal_country <- coal_long %>% 
  filter(!(region %in% coal_continent)) ## data broken into countries

coal_world <- coal_long %>% 
  filter(region %in% world) ## world overview data

unique(coal_region$region)
unique(coal_country$region)
unique(coal_world$region)


## Let's see some insights with ggplot2
### Region

ggplot(coal_region, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_point() ## basic plot

ggplot(coal_region, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_line() ## messy lines

ggplot(coal_region, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_line(mapping = aes(color=region)) ## separate lines per country

### Country

ggplot(coal_country, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_line() ## messy

ggplot(coal_country, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_line(mapping = aes(color=region)) ## plot doesn't show due to legend

ggplot(coal_country, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_jitter() ## plot doesn't show due to legend

### World

ggplot(coal_world, mapping = aes(year,coal_consumption))+
  geom_smooth()
